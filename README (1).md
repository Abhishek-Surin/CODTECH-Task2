# Overview of the Project

Project Title: TO-DO LIST Web Application

Objective: This simple application provides a basic, user-friendly interface for managing tasks using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.









## Key Points of the To-Do web application:
Add Task: Users can add new tasks using the input field and button.

Complete Task: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status, applying a strikethrough and changing the background color.

Delete Task: Each task has a delete button that removes it from the list.




## Features of the To-Do List App

Intuitive Interface:

Clear Layout: The app has a clean and minimalistic design, making it easy for users to understand and navigate.
Input Field and Button: Users can quickly add tasks using a straightforward input field and an "Add Task" button.

Task Management:

Adding Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list by entering text and clicking the "Add Task" button.

Marking Tasks as Completed: Users can click on tasks to mark them as completed, which visually distinguishes them with a strikethrough and different background color.

Deleting Tasks: Each task has a delete button, allowing users to remove tasks from the list easily.

Visual Feedback:

Task Completion: Completed tasks are visually different (e.g., strikethrough text and a different background color), providing clear feedback to users.

Hover Effects: Buttons and tasks might have hover effects to indicate interactivity, enhancing the user experience.

Responsive Design:

Mobile-Friendly: The layout adjusts well to different screen sizes, ensuring a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
